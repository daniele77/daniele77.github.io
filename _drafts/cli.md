In my work I often develop applications meant to run for a long period of time,without a classic intercation with the user (i.e., a gui).
sometimes they are applications that run in a server, sometimes in a custom board, but almost never in a laptop.
Their other characteristic is that they're not cpu bounded applications.

I FIND OUT that it's very useful
