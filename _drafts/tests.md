* See http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/1019 

* I agree with the general sense of the post, but I disagree with this:

"When you start looking at the work of developers in this way,
you start to see the value of dynamic languages, where building
the app is istantaneous, and the time saved in this way may trump
the supposed gains obtained by static typing. You also start looking
at the long compile times of C++ or Scala, and you see that those 
languages were not designed with the need of fast software delivery in mind."

* my point is that the time spent compiling an application, is not a waste.
* compilation is useful to find syntax errors and [when using types in the right way] also
  some semantic errors.
* in script languages you need 100% test coverage to find syntax errors
* dynamic languages -> runtime problem with types -> you need 100% test coverage
* so, the time spent in compilation is the equivalent to 100% test coverage of non compiled languages
*
