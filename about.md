<!-- Some information about you! -->

Passionate about software design. Speaker. Author. Runner. 

### More Information

<!--
A place to include any other types of information that you'd like to include about yourself.
-->
I've been programming and designing software for the last 20+ years and I'm passionate about it.
I keep studying the theory, principles and practice in software design and development.

### Support

Unfortunately it's difficult to write articles and blog posts,
start new open source projects, maintain a high
level of quality, add new features and give support on different tools,
not being able to work on them except in the free time.

This is why **your support is important and can make the difference**.

If you like my works and you're using them in your real world products or if you
just want to help me, consider to [**become a sponsor**](https://github.com/users/daniele77/sponsorship) and
allow me to spend more and more time on the projects you love.
