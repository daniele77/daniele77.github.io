In my work, I often develop applications meant to run for a long period of time,
without a classic interaction with the user (i.e., without a proper UI).
Sometimes, they are applications running on a server, sometimes in a custom board,
but they are almost never desktop applications.
Their other characteristic is that they're not CPU bound applications,
i.e., they're not the kind of number crunching applications that you start
and then wait for an output.

Soon enough, I realized that it's very useful to have some sort of console
to interact with my applications, particularly the embedded kind
where the software is running around the clock,
so that you can easily monitor, configure and manage your system.
<!-- Cisco routers, for example, have a command line interface, and so many devices that run unattended. -->
After all, this idea is nothing new:
Cisco routers, for example, are known for their command line interface,
and the same goes for many devices that run unattended.

If you're working on this kind of software, you should definitely consider adding
a command line interface at least for debugging purpose.
For example wouldn't it be great connecting to your embedded software using a telnet client
to ask the internal state, view a dump of some internal structure,
modify the log level at runtime, change the working mode, enable or disable some modules,
load or unload some plugin?

When you're in production, the benefits of an interactive (and possibly remote) command line are obvious.
But consider the initial phases of development, too.
When you're writing the first prototype of
an application doing I/O on custom devices,
<!-- a I/O bound application [### trovare il giusto termine. in questo caso reactive system sarebbe meglio]. -->
chances are that you start writing some core features to communicate with the real word:
implementing some protocol, some module that does I/O, and so on.
How do you test them? You can write a `main` function that drives your piece of software
but, except for simple cases, you also need some sort of state machine to interact correctly with the hardware.
So, either you develop a state machine or you use a more interactive solution.
A CLI, for example :-)

Let's imagine: you're writing your protocol stack to speak with a legacy machine. You've got
primitives to tell the machine to start the electric motor, to stop it, to change direction
as well as the notifications for all the meaningful events.
Now you can add to your `main` function a command line interface,
and register a command for each primitive.
In this way you can immediately begin to test use cases complex at will on your module,
in an incremental manner
(of course this requires to be able to write incremental modular code too,
but this is a subject for another post :-).

## Reinventing the wheel, as usual...

So, I needed a CLI for my C++ projects.
As every good developer, when I need something, I first start by looking at open source libraries
to see if there exists something that works for me. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything
that completely fit my needs. In particular, the vast majority of libraries available
work only on Linux, or they aren't libraries at all, but applications
in which you have to hook external programs to commands. None of them
provides remote sessions. Few are written in C++. None of them in modern C++.

Eventually, I wrote my own library, in C++14. It's available on 
[my GitHub page](https://github.com/daniele77/cli). It has production code quality
and has been used in several industrial projects.

A brief summary of features:

* C++14
* Cross-platform (Linux and windows tested)
* Menus and submenus
* Remote sessions (telnet)
* Command history (navigation with arrow keys)
* Autocompletion (with TAB key)
* Async interface
* Colors

It has a dependency from `boost::asio` to provide an asynchronous interface
(for those cases when you want a single thread application)
and to implement the telnet server.

The library is all I needed for my projects. When I have a remote board running my software,
I find it very handy to telnet on a specific port
of the board to get a shell on my application. I can have a look at the internal
state of the software, increase the log level when something strange happens,
even give commands to change the behavior or reset the state if something goes wrong.

## Show me some code!

Just to show you the syntax of the library, this is an example of a working
application providing both a local prompt and a remote command line interface,
with menus and submenus:

```c++
#include "cli/clilocalsession.h"
#include "cli/remotecli.h"
#include "cli/cli.h"

using namespace cli;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // setup cli

    auto rootMenu = make_unique< Menu >( "cli" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "hello",
            [](std::ostream& out){ out << "Hello, world\n"; },
            "Print hello world" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "hello_everysession",
            [](std::ostream&)
                { Cli::cout() << "Hello, everybody" << std::endl; },
            "Print hello everybody on all open sessions" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "answer",
            [](int x, std::ostream& out)
                { out << "The answer is: " << x << "\n"; },
            "Print the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "color",
            [](std::ostream& out)
                { out << "Colors ON\n"; SetColor(); },
            "Enable colors in the cli" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "nocolor",
            [](std::ostream& out)
                { out << "Colors OFF\n"; SetNoColor(); },
            "Disable colors in the cli" );

    auto subMenu = make_unique< Menu >( "sub" );
    subMenu -> Add(
            "hello",
            [](std::ostream& out){ out << "Hello, submenu world\n"; },
            "Print hello world in the submenu" );
    subMenu -> Add(
            "demo",
            [](std::ostream& out){ out << "This is a sample!\n"; },
            "Print a demo string" );

    auto subSubMenu = make_unique< Menu >( "subsub" );
        subSubMenu -> Add(
            "hello",
            [](std::ostream& out)
                { out << "Hello, subsubmenu world\n"; },
            "Print hello world in the sub-submenu" );
    subMenu -> Add( std::move(subSubMenu));

    rootMenu -> Add( std::move(subMenu) );

    Cli cli( std::move(rootMenu) );
    // global exit action
    cli.ExitAction( [](auto& out)
        { out << "Goodbye and thanks for all the fish.\n"; } );

    boost::asio::io_service ios;

    // setup local session (gives an application prompt)

    CliLocalTerminalSession localSession(cli, ios, std::cout, 200);
    localSession.ExitAction(
        [&ios](auto& out) // session exit action
        {
            out << "Closing App...\n";
            ios.stop();
        }
    );

    // setup server (for telnet sessions on port 5000)

    CliTelnetServer server(ios, 5000, cli);
    // exit action for all the connections
    server.ExitAction( [](auto& out) 
        { out << "Terminating this session...\n"; } );
    ios.run();

    return 0;
}
```

If you don't need the remote console and a synchronous application is enough,
you can simplify the setup and get rid of `boost asio`:

```c++
#include "cli/cli.h"
#include "cli/clifilesession.h"

using namespace cli;
using namespace std;


int main()
{
    // setup cli

    auto rootMenu = make_unique< Menu >( "cli" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "hello",
            [](std::ostream& out){ out << "Hello, world\n"; },
            "Print hello world" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "hello_everysession",
            [](std::ostream&)
                { Cli::cout() << "Hello, everybody" << std::endl; },
            "Print hello everybody on all open sessions" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "answer",
            [](int x, std::ostream& out)
                { out << "The answer is: " << x << "\n"; },
            "Print the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "color",
            [](std::ostream& out){ out << "Colors ON\n"; SetColor(); },
            "Enable colors in the cli" );
    rootMenu -> Add(
            "nocolor",
            [](std::ostream& out)
                { out << "Colors OFF\n"; SetNoColor(); },
            "Disable colors in the cli" );

    auto subMenu = make_unique< Menu >( "sub" );
    subMenu -> Add(
            "hello",
            [](std::ostream& out){ out << "Hello, submenu world\n"; },
            "Print hello world in the submenu" );
    subMenu -> Add(
            "demo",
            [](std::ostream& out){ out << "This is a sample!\n"; },
            "Print a demo string" );

    auto subSubMenu = make_unique< Menu >( "subsub" );
        subSubMenu -> Add(
            "hello",
            [](std::ostream& out)
                { out << "Hello, subsubmenu world\n"; },
            "Print hello world in the sub-submenu" );
    subMenu -> Add( std::move(subSubMenu));

    rootMenu -> Add( std::move(subMenu) );


    Cli cli( std::move(rootMenu) );
    // global exit action
    cli.ExitAction( [](auto& out)
        { out << "Goodbye and thanks for all the fish.\n"; } );

    CliFileSession input(cli);
    input.Start();

    return 0;
}
```

## Just for embedded applications?

Of course no.
The `cli` library has several uses beyond
the remote supervision of embedded software.
It can be a console for UI-less applications, like game servers;
as a way to configure network devices;
a flexible tool to test library code.

You can put a CLI basically in every application: sooner or later, it will come in handy.
