Welcome to my blog :-)

Soon here you will find some articles on the subject of programming and software design.

I've been designing and developing software in the last couple of decades,
both industrial applications and open source libraries,
and collected many notes in the process.
My intention is to use this blog to share some of my thoughts and things I learned
during these years.

Stay tuned.
