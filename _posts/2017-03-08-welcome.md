Welcome to my blog :-)

Shortly here you will find some essays covering programming and software design.

Iâ€™ve been designing and developing software in the last couple of decades,
both industrial applications and open source libraries, and collected many notes in the process.
My aim is to use this blog to share some of my thoughts and things I learned during these years.

Stay tuned.
